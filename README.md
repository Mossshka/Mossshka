Ham radio is not dead, and you should use it.
Many people in 2021 think that phones are the gateway to everything. Which is why many people think that
ham radio is useless. Now you may ask what is ham radio? Ham radio is a radio that lets you transmit on
specific frequencies, but you need a license. take it as having a radio tower in your pocket.
It was cool until cell phones. Then everyone turned it off and left it in the basement... 
But it still found popularity in many ways.

2020 got the ball rolling because of COVID-19. ‘Preppers’ bought tons of hams and started using them as a hobby.
And many old operators returned to the hobby.

Another type of radio is called CB radio or citizen’s band which allows 
you to operate at low power frequencies with no license.
But it’s definitely dead because if you go into a CB store they say buy a ham radio. 
It’s commonly used by truckers, but many truckers got into ham instead of CB.

On the ham bands there are many different types of people and many different types of stations you can contact,
some stations are only listen because everybody’s listening to them, like the police reports, the airport and especially
the most commonly known that you might have at your house or probably in your car the NOAA reports.this is one of
the best reasons to get a ham.

Repeaters are a great way to start off your ham license.
if you use one because many people listen in to repeaters and talk on them! Furthermore spreading the popularity.

Now imagine this sort of doomsday scenario where all power goes off Worldwide, and you have a ham. No WiFi or cellular is useable 
to operate it it’s  a offline tool. The question is why do we still use phones.

So that’s why I think ham radio is not dead and if all power went out and you had no Wi-Fi
and no solar panels you too would buy a ham and if you get one early you could, you know try out the Hobby
and have some fun while doing it. And many people do this. It’s not a small hobby. You could get out there and 
enjoy the hobby for yourself! 

See you on the bands!
